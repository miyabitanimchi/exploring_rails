## Notes for myself

- Rails is MVC architecture
  - Models: Dataabases
  - Views: Webpages
  - Controllers: Interface between Model and View
- `rails routes` to show all the routes
- `rails g scaffold DB_NAME first_name: string last_name: string...` to create a model
- `rails db:migrate` to migrate DB
- `rails g controller NAME` to create a controller
