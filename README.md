# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

- Ruby version

- System dependencies

- Configuration

- Database creation

- Database initialization

- How to run the test suite

- Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

- Deployment instructions

- ...

## Notes for myself

- Rails is MVC architecture
  - Models: Dataabases
  - Views: Webpages
  - Controllers: Interface between Model and View
- `rails routes` to show all the routes
